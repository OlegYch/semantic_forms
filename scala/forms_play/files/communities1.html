<p>We like to have a concept-centered view, which shows what happened recently on that. Thanks to the new <code>/history?uri=</code> feature, that's exactly what we can do. Precisely it shows the URI's reached from there by RDF paths of length &lt;= 2, sorted in the historical order. This can be seen as a way of expliciting communities of interest. We can focus on any URI: an entry from Wikipedia / dbPedia, a project, a person, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the biodiversity day at ISWC a biodiversity community was launched: <a href="/history?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org%%202Fresource%%202FBiodiversity">Biodiversity community</a></li>
<li>NLP (Natural Language Processing) <a href="/history?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org%%202Fresource%%202FNatural_language_processing">NLP interest group</a></li>
<li>everything related to software development: <a href="/history?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org%%202Fresource%%202FComputer_programming">developers community</a></li>
</ul>
